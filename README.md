# **Music Bike: Adaptive Music System for Cyclists**
### **Overview**
Music Bike is an embedded systems project aimed at creating a hardware-software solution that adapts music playback in real time based on what is happening during a cyclist's ride. By leveraging sensors to collect data such as speed, cadence, motion, and environment, Music Bike dynamically adjusts music tempo, rhythm, and intensity to enhance the cycling experience.

---

### **Features**
- **Real-Time Music Adaptation**: Adjusts music playback based on riding speed, pedal cadence, jumps, and other motion data.  
- **Sensor Integration**: Utilizes multiple sensors (e.g., speed sensor, accelerometer, force sensor) to collect live cycling data.  
- **Wireless Connectivity**: Transmits sensor data to a mobile app via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).  

---

### **Project Goals**
1. Develop hardware capable of accurately collecting cycling data using sensors.  
2. Design algorithms to map sensor data to dynamic music playback parameters.  
3. Build a mobile app for real-time interaction and customization.  
4. Test the system in controlled and real-world cycling environments.

### **Technologies Used**
- **Microcontroller**: ESP32 for wireless connectivity and sensor integration.  
- **Sensors**: Speed sensor, cadence sensor, accelerometer, force sensor, environmental sensor (details in `/docs/sensors.md`).  
- **Programming Languages**: 
- **Mobile App**: React Native or Flutter (TBD) for cross-platform support.
